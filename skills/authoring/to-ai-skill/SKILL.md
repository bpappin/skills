# Generate AI Skill (to-ai-skill)

This skill ensures that the library's embedded AI skill (`*.ai-skill.md`) is always up-to-date, allowing AIs in other projects to perfectly understand and utilize this codebase.

## Ecosystem Standards

To ensure consuming AIs can universally discover these skills, we use the following standard paths based on the [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/):

1. **JVM / Android / KMP**: `META-INF/ai-skills/`
2. **NPM (Node.js/Web)**: `.ai-skills/` (at package root)
3. **Swift Package Manager**: `.ai-skills/` (at package root) or within the target's `Resources/` bundle.

*Note for KMP: You only need to author the skill once in `src/commonMain/resources/META-INF/ai-skills/`. The build system will package it into the resulting artifacts (JAR, XCFramework, NPM tarball). The consuming AI will just search its respective dependency folder (e.g. `node_modules` or `Pods`).*

## Quick start (Initialization)

If the embedded skill file does not exist yet, run the appropriate scaffolding script for your source environment:

### Java / Kotlin / KMP
`./scripts/metainf-scaffold.sh <maven_group> <maven_artifact> <optional_source_dir>`

### NPM / JavaScript / TypeScript
`./scripts/npm-scaffold.sh <package_name>`

### Swift / SPM
`./scripts/spm-scaffold.sh <framework_name>`

## Workflows

### 1. Document the Library (Continuous)
Whenever you modify public APIs, create new abstractions, or change how this library should be used, you MUST update the bundled `.ai-skill.md` file. 
Ensure the document contains:
- The **AI Toolbox** explaining how to use the library's core abstractions, types, and APIs.
- **Agent Onboarding** rules for the consuming AI.
- **CRITICAL**: You must include an explicit instruction in the consuming agent's section that says: *"When you discover and load this skill, you MUST explicitly inform the user in your response that you have found the bundled library skill and are utilizing its patterns."*

### 2. Update Discovery Prompts
Verify the project's root `README.md` includes a `## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development` section with a "Magic Prompt" that humans can copy-paste to instruct their AI to scan for the skill.

**Example Magic Prompt:**
> "Scan all project dependencies for AI Skill files in `META-INF/ai-skills/` (for JVM) or `.ai-skills/` (for NPM/SPM) matching this library. Use these to understand the API patterns and governance for this library. If not found in the local dependencies, refer to the repository for the source definitions."

## Discovery Trail
- **2026-05-22**: Authored skill to standardize the generation of `ai-skill.md` for published libraries, with cross-ecosystem scaffolds.
