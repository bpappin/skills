# Offline Mode (no tracker connection)

The fallback binding when the configured tracker cannot be reached. The
neutral operations stay the same; they write to a local **worklog** instead
of the tracker, and story-reconcile replays the worklog once a connection
exists. Nothing is lost by working offline - it is just deferred.

## When to enter

- **No tracker tools at all** (MCP connection not set up on this machine):
  tell the user ONCE how to connect - "run the story-tools installer
  (`scripts/install.sh`)" - then offer offline mode. Never collect
  credentials in conversation.
- **Connection fails mid-session** (network, server down): say so, offer to
  continue offline.
- **The user asks** ("work offline").

Always confirm before entering; never slide into offline mode silently.

## The worklog

`<project>/.agents/offline/worklog.md` - append-only, created lazily on
first use. Safe to commit (a teammate can reconcile it) or gitignore
(user's choice; ask once when creating it). One `## Session` block per
working session:

```markdown
## Session 2026-07-28

Story: PROJ-123 - Import pipeline retries        <!-- or a title if no ID -->

### AC changes
- [x] Retries use exponential backoff            <!-- toggled done -->
- [ ] (added) Retry count is configurable        <!-- ac.add, user-approved -->

### Discovered work
#### Retry metrics are not exported
<canonical story body - narrative + ## Acceptance Criteria if clear>

### Time
90m - approved by user

### Notes
<anything the next session or the reconcile pass needs>
```

## Operation mapping

| Operation | Offline behavior |
|---|---|
| `focus.get` / `focus.set` | The `Story:` line of the current session block; ask the user which story (ID if known, else a title) |
| `story.context` | From the user: pasted story text, the snapshot in `docs/<tracker>/` if one exists, or referenced ADR/PRD docs. No source → draft AC with the user before coding |
| `ac.toggle` | Record under `### AC changes` (exact item text, checked) |
| `ac.add` | Same, marked `(added)` - still requires explicit user approval |
| `work.discovered` | Canonical story block under `### Discovered work` - the off-ramp rules are unchanged: log it, tell the user, continue the focused story |
| `story.completeCheck` | Parse the AC you have; report the verdict and record it in Notes. Never declare done beyond what you can verify |
| `work.logTime` | `### Time` entry - still one rounded, user-approved number per session |

All scope-guard rules apply verbatim offline: the AC list is the scope, the
off-ramp is the default for anything else, silent expansion is still
forbidden.

## Leaving offline mode

When a connection is available again (or the user says so), offer to replay
the worklog via the **story-reconcile** skill - it proposes every pending
entry for approval before anything is written, marks each session block
`Reconciled: <date>` as it lands, and offers to delete the file when all
sessions are applied. Never replay the worklog silently.
