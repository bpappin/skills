**git-guardrails-gemini**: Codifies the strict Git safety rules for Gemini CLI.

**grill-me**: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until reaching shared understanding.

**grill-with-docs**: Grilling session that challenges your plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallise.

**handoff**: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent to pick up.

**housekeeping**: Perform workspace housekeeping, cleanup audits, and prepare handoff/commit documentation at the end of a work session.

**improve-codebase-architecture**: Find deepening opportunities in a codebase, informed by the domain language in CONTEXT.md and the decisions in docs/adr/.

**manage-docs**: Manage the 15-sector documentation hierarchy, perform semantic migrations of legacy documentation, and provide proactive recording of architectural and functional decisions.

**manage-persona**: Initialize and manage persona state via a global persona.json file.

**manage-skills**: Manage the lifecycle, organization, and synchronization of AI agent skills between local project workspaces and master skill sources.

**to-design**: Formalizes the design-capturing process as a structured agent capability to ensure visual samples are generated and properly registered.

**to-issues**: Break a plan, spec, or PRD into independently-grabbable issues on the project issue tracker using tracer-bullet vertical slices.

**to-prd**: Turn conversation context and codebase understanding into a formal PRD and matching AC spec.

**to-research**: Manage Technical Research & Development (R&D) logs.

**triage**: Triage issues through a state machine driven by triage roles.
