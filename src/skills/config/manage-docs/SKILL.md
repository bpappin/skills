# Documentation Management

## The 6-Sector Hierarchy

All knowledge must be dispersed into the appropriate specialized directory to ensure high-quality AI context mapping and prevent documentation bloat. Technical specifications MUST live in the project repository (docs-as-code) rather than external wikis to ensure atomic versioning and peer review.

| Sector | Path | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mandates** | `docs/mandates/` | Global "How" and "What" (`ARCH.md`, `SPEC.md`). |
| **Templates** | `docs/mandates/templates/` | Blueprints for different document archetypes. |
| **Design** | `DESIGN.md` | The canonical design specification and tokens (Root). **Domain: Designer Persona.** |
| **Mockups** | `docs/design/` | Individual feature designs and mockups. **Domain: Designer Persona.** |
| **Stories** | `docs/prd/` | Feature requirements and user stories (**PRDs**). Linked to **AC**. |
| **Criteria** | `docs/ac/` | Testable success outcomes (**ACs**). Linked to **PRD**. |
| **Discovery** | `docs/discovery/` | The "Why" and "Due Diligence" (DD). Vendor research and cost analysis. |
| **Roadmap** | `docs/gap/` | The "Future" (GAPs). Transient trackers for missing capabilities. |
| **Regulations**| `docs/regulations/` | Compliance mappings (PIPEDA, GDPR, Law 25). |
| **Guides** | `docs/guides/` | The "Environment" (Onboarding and Installation). |
| **Reference** | `docs/reference/` | Domain-specific knowledge and IDV methods. |
| **Research** | `docs/research/` | Deep-dive R&D logs (RAD) and Architectural Decisions (ADR). |

## Workflows

### 1. Polymorphic Layouts (Archetypes)
When creating new documentation (PRDs, GAPs, Designs), the agent must select the correct layout based on the active persona:
1.  **Detection**: Check the active persona's `layout_preference`.
2.  **Selection**: 
    - Use `docs/mandates/templates/prd-game-design.md` if layout is `game-design`.
    - Use `docs/mandates/templates/prd-standard.md` if layout is `standard` or no persona is active.
3.  **Customization**: If the user asks for a specific layout not in their persona, honor the request but tag the document with `**Layout:** [type]` in the metadata.

### 2. Bootstrapping DESIGN.md
If the root `DESIGN.md` is missing, the agent MUST offer to bootstrap it using the [Google DESIGN.md specification](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/specification/). It should incorporate project-specific UI rules found in any legacy design documentation.

### 3. Spec Pairing (PRD + AC)
When a feature is defined, it is recorded as a pair of files using a shared ID:
1.  **Requirement**: `docs/prd/[ID]-slug.md`. Contains user stories and implementation decisions.
2.  **Verification**: `docs/ac/[ID]-slug.md`. Contains testable Gherkin-style scenarios.
3.  **Note**: If a task is purely informational or non-testable, omit the AC and mark the PRD's Verification section as "N/A".

### 4. Migration Workflow ("migrate docs")
Use this to ingest legacy documentation or clean up an unorganized repository.
1.  **Scan**: Search the project root and folders like `wiki/`, `notes/`, or `architecture/` for `.md` and `.txt` files.
2.  **Classify**: Semantically analyze the content to determine its target sector (e.g., "Given/When/Then" ➔ `docs/ac/`).
3.  **Report**: Present a proposal table of source files and their proposed structured paths.
4.  **Execute**: Move files, update cross-references, and initialize missing `README.md` indexes.
5.  **Refactor**: Rename any existing `docs/issue/` directory to `docs/prd/`.

### 5. Agentic Proactivity (Soft Offer)
Monitor the conversation for "Resolution Signals" and offer to record them:
- **The Trade-off Signal**: If 2+ options were compared and one chosen ➔ Offer a **DD** (Discovery) or **ADR** (Decision).
- **The Feature Signal**: If "how it should work" is mapped ➔ Offer a **PRD** and **AC** pair.
- **The Roadmap Signal**: If a task is important but out-of-scope ➔ Offer a **GAP**.

### 6. Due Diligence (DD) Records
Before making significant architectural choices, create a DD record in `docs/discovery/`.
- **Discovery Trail**: ALWAYS include a section summarizing the back-and-forth discussion and AI reasoning that led to the findings.

### 7. Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
Record hard-to-reverse or surprising technical decisions in `docs/adr/`.
- **Format**: `XXXX-slug.md`. Keep it concise (1-3 sentences for context/decision).
- **Linking**: Cross-link to related **DD** or **PRD** records.

## Discovery Trail
- **2026-05-18**: Integrated `DESIGN.md` root specification into the 6-sector hierarchy. Added bootstrapping workflow to ensure `DESIGN.md` is created following the Google spec. Defined `DESIGN.md` and `docs/design/` as the exclusive domain of the **Designer Persona**.
- **2026-05-18 (v2)**: Introduced Polymorphic Layouts (Documentation Archetypes). Added `docs/mandates/templates/` directory to house blueprints for `standard` and `game-design` layouts. Linked layout selection to the user's active persona preference.
